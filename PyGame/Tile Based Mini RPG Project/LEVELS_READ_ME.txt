-Files containing maps for levels should be named: level_[level number].txt
-It should be a file containing 25 lines of 25 characters

Key:
#: outer wall
+: inner wall
P: player spawn
0: a space where nothing should be spawned

Note:
-a blank space represents free space for the player to move and a place enemies may be spawned
-put a 0 in the bottom right corner so the portal for the next level will not spawn on top of something
